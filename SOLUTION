Kernel System Calls
-------------------
this create a directory in which there is a file containing the following sentence : "Here you go ... Tell me what I d"



Broken Symlink
-------------------
latest-backup.obj file, it cannot find the file it points to because its path has changed and the soft link is broke.
the solution is we will have to move the file backup-2024-06-21.obj to the same folder where latest-backup.obj is
located , or creating a new link to the new path.
1. mv backup-2024-06-21.obj backups/
2. ln -s ../$FILENAME latest-backup.obj


Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111 = 7 , 100 = 4 , 10110 = 22
2. 0-255
3. if we have 9 bits binary number and we want to differentiate between negative and positive numbers between -255 and
255 ,we will use the 9 bit from right to left . if the 9 bit equal 1 this number is negative and if the 9 bit equal 0
positive.
4.for floating point , i suggest that 4 bits on the right represent the number after the point and 4 bits on the left
represent the whole number.
